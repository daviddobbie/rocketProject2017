# Active Stabilisation Gyroscope Gimbal MK2
This is the second iteration of the rocket motor gimbal
This design was the first revision intented for intergration into a rocket system. 

Issues that were raised with the previous version have been addressed, these include
    * The Mk1 version was implemented with a large mounting plate that was deemed unnecessary
    * The rocket motor requires clearance at both ends due to the primary burn and secondary ejection charge firing from opposite ends. The MK1 gimbal had several structural and mechcanical components in the path of the secondary charge. These componets would be damaged during flight casuing reduced operational ability and reduced componet reusability. 

### Hardware Required 

    * HKM-282A Servo
    * 1/32 inch control rod
