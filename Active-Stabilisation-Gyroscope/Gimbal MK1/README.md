(Onshape Document)[https://cad.onshape.com/documents/ac475682b0dcfe2c53e7e1ff/v/3444c01671885e14ab2c2e17/e/2e63972efa3253e1ef49b592]

This inital design was intended to test the dual ring gyroscopic design for the gimbal. There was no intention for this inital design to be integrated into any rocket system. This iteration gave clarification that the design would provide the required motor movement to make course corrections while in flight.

### Hardware Required

    * HKM-282A Servo
