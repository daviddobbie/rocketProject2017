This design was made to have similar operation to the previous gimbal revisions using the dual ring gyroscopic system. This gimbal design provided the ability to operate rockets using up to a G class rocket motor. This therefore meaning that larger rockets could be launched with this design. This design was made to be integrated into the 1st stage (Booster stage) of the projects 2 stage active to passive rocket system
